Fraud discovery is a challenging problem. The fact is that fraudulent transactions are rare; they represent a tiny fraction of activity within an organization. The challenge is that a small percentage of business can quickly turn into significant dollar losses without the right tools and systems in place. As popular fraud schemes fail to pay off, fraudsters have learned to change their tactics. The great news is that with progress in machine learning, models can learn, adjust, and reveal emerging patterns for stopping fraud.
